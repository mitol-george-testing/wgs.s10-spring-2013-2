description: This mural was designed by women imprisoned at Riker's Island, a jail
  in New York City, and was painted by the women's children on a wall in East Harlem.
  In addition, the children designed a mural that the mothers then painted inside
  a building at Rikers. Read more about the project, If Walls Could Talk. (Image courtesy
